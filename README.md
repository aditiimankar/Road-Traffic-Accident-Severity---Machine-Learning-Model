# Classification-  Road Traffic Accident Severity
This is a multiclass classification project to classify the severity of road accidents into three categories.
The degree of severity in road traffic accidents hinges on a multitude of factors encompassing the characteristics of the involved vehicles, drivers, casualties, and the prevailing environmental conditions. The primary objective of this project is to construct predictive models that leverage these factors to categorize accident severity into three classes: minor injury, significant injury, or fatal injury. The dataset employed for this project was curated from manual records of road traffic incidents spanning the years 2017 to 2020, sourced from the police departments within Addis Ababa sub-city. The data encoding process has been undertaken with utmost care to exclude any sensitive information. The final dataset comprises records for 12,316 accidents, each featuring 32 distinct attributes.

Problem Statement: The target feature is Accident_severity which is a multi-class variable. The task is to classify this variable based on the other 31 features step-by-step by going through each day's task. Your metric for evaluation will be f1-score.
