# RoadAccidentSeverity_ML_Model


This machine learning model is designed to predict the severity of road accidents based on various factors such as education, sex, age, type of vehicle, time, road alignment, and lanes or medians. The model uses encoding techniques, hyperparameter tuning, and baseline modeling to improve its accuracy, and also includes upsampling to address any class imbalance in the dataset.
